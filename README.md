# todo_app

This Flutter project is a basic todo list application that allows users to add, view, and manage their daily tasks. The app is built using the Flutter Bloc state management library, making it easy to manage the app's state in a scalable way. It also incorporates local data storage using SharedPreferences, ensuring tasks are stored persistently between app sessions.
